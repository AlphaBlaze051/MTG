To use the program with your own card list you must enter in the file name without the file type and the custom card list must be in the same place as the .exe file.

When using the list making feature you must enter in the card name exactly as it is on the card(if your not sure how a card is spelt look at the AllCards.txt file where you can see a full list of all the cards and how they are spelt and formated for the program)

Simply run the exe and click the options menu button to select the list or filtering options.

If you have any problems or have sugestions for improvments in design or look please email me at Aj.dj.email@gmail.com with the subject "MTG pro"
(Please remember that this is just a beta at this point in time and there will be many changes in the near future)
