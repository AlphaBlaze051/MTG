To use the program you must run the MTGGUI.py program but first you need to make sure that you have the modules tkinter, mergedeep, ast and pickle

You also need to download and have CardInfo.py and test.txt in the same directory/folder as MTGGUI.py

if you get any errors or sugestions for improvment please email me at Aj.dj.email@gmail.com with the subject "MTG pro"
